    WDFComponents: TwoPortInductorUnitElement   
-------------
    Wave Digital electric components, based in the theory of A. Feitweiss and other source like DAFX Knowledge 
    Created By Juan Manuel Medina for own proposes and Prismatik LAB division: DSP.Erience. This Class is oriented 
    to linear 2PN (Two Port Networks), for implementation / feedback or more info,  write to: prismatiklab@gmail.com
-------------
    This class is a model for one or n elements using MNA (Modified Nodal Analysis) with the most posible WDF elements like parasites, reflection, propagation, 
    Transfer function, Z, Y and others parameters. The non-linear coefficient is 0, because the nature of behavior of resistors, 
    capacitors and inductors (linear components).
