-------------
    Wave Digital electric components, based in the theory of A. Feitweiss and other source like DAFX Knowledge 
    Created By Juan Manuel Medina for own proposes and Prismatik LAB division: DSP.Erience. This Class is oriented 
    to linear 2PN (Two Port Networks), for implementation / feedback or more info,  write to: prismatiklab@gmail.com

    Using the method MNA (Modified Nodal Analysis) for linear circuits nodal proposes.
